In general, this repository should be used for the majority of code related to projects in the laboratory, even ephemeral code that might not 
seem useful today (who knows?). When code is in development, and you are just using it for your own purposes, you can keep it in your own folder.
As the code becomes more general and can be repurposed, consider sliding it into the Lab folder (or at least have a usable version in there). 
Try to comment your code with a note about what it does, and what the arguments and values are.
