v1.0-4, 2014-03-18
New features:
- subset.pyRAD.loci adds snpLocs to its value, identifying locations of SNPs in the exported data
- subset.pyRAD.loci adds snpsOnly option, allowing user to just export SNP positions for loci
- Added group.pyRAD.loci to identify loci that have > n individuals of each of the groups submitted [NO DOCS YET]
- Added tidyName to clean up names for comparing names that may have messy characters added [NO DOCS YET]
- Added genotypes.pyRAD.loci to export genotype matrices to hierfstat [NO DOCS YET]
- write.DNAStringSet now does fasta as well as phylip

Other notes:
- There is an indexing problem in hierfstat's getal function that we are getting around by sorting our group numbers in genotypes [NOT DOCUMENTED; will notify hierfstat developers]
